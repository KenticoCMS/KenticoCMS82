            <summary>
            A single static class which controls the device detection process.
            </summary>
            <para>
            The process uses 3 steps to determine the properties associated with the
            provided user agent.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 1 - each of the character positions of the target user agent are checked
            from right to left to determine if a complete node or sub string is present
            at that position. For example; the sub string Chrome/11 might indicate the 
            user agent relates to Chrome version 11 from Google. Once every character
            position is checked a list of matching nodes will be available.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 2 - The list of signatures is then searched to determine if the matching 
            nodes relate exactly to an existing signature. Any popular device will be found
            at this point. The approach is exceptionally fast at identifying popular
            devices. This is termed the Exact match method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 3 - If a match has not been found exactly then the target user agent is
            evaluated to find nodes that have the smallest numeric difference. For example
            if Chrome/40 were in the target user agent at the same position as Chrome/32 
            in the signature then Chrome/32 with a numeric difference score of 8 would be
            used. If a signature can then be matched exactly against the new set of nodes
            this will be returned. This is termed the Numeric match method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 4 - If the target user agent is less popular, or newer than the creation time
            of the data set, a small sub set of possible signatures are identified from the
            matchied nodes. The sub set is limited to the most popular 200 signatures.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 5 - The sub strings of the signatures from Step 4 are then evaluated to determine
            if they exist in the target user agent. For example if Chrome/32 in the target 
            appears one character to the left of Chrome/32 in the signature then a difference
            of 1 would be returned between the signature and the target. This is termed the
            Nearest match method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Step 6 - The signatures from Step 4 are evaluated against the target user agent to 
            determine the difference in relevent characters between them. The signature with the 
            lowest difference in ASCII character values with the target is returned. This is termed
            the Closest match method.
            </para>
            <remarks>
            Random user agents will not identify any matching nodes. In these situations a 
            default set of profiles are returned.
            </remarks>
            <remarks>
            The characteristics of the detection data set will determine the accuracy of the
            result match. Older data sets that are unaware of the latest devices, or user agent
            formats in use will be less accurate.

            <summary>
            ASCII format strings are the only ones used in the data set. Many
            native string formats use Unicode format using 2 bytes for every 
            character. This is inefficient when only ASCII values are being 
            stored. The <see cref="T:FiftyOne.Foundation.Mobile.Detection.Entities.AsciiString"/> class wraps a byte array of 
            ASCII characters and exposes them as a native string type when 
            required.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Strings stored as ASCII strings include, the relevant characters 
            from signatures, sub strings longer than 4 characters, property
            and value names, the descriptions and URLs associated with 
            properties and values.

            Properties can return none, one or many values. The IsList property should be refered to
            to determine the number of values to expect. Properties where IsList is false will only
            return upto one value.

            <para>
            A signature contains those characters of a user agent which are relevent for the
            purposes of device detection. For example; most user agents will start with
            "Mozilla" and therefore these characters are of very little use when detecting
            devices. Other characters such as those that represent the model of the hardware
            are very relevent.
            </para>
            <para>
            A signature contains both an array of relevent characters from user agents identified
            when the data was created and the unique complete node identifies of relevent sub strings
            contained in multiple signatures and user agents. Together this information is used
            at detection time to rapidly identify the signature matching a target user agent.

            Signatures relate to device properties via profiles. Each signature relates to one

            <para>
            This class uses the offset of the first byte of the entities data in the underlying
            data structure in the accessor. As such the list isn't being used as a traditional
            list because items are not retrieved by their index in the list, but by there offset
            in the underlying data structure.
            </para>
            <remarks>
            The constructor will read the header information about the underlying data structure.
            The data for each entity is only loaded when requested via the accessor. A cache is used
            to avoid creating duplicate objects when requested multiple times.
            </remarks>
            <remarks>
            Data sources which don't support seeking can not be used. Specifically compressed data

            </summary>
            <para>
            The memory usage of the resulting data set following initialisation will be consistent. 
            The performance of the data set will be very fast compared to the stream based
            implementation as all required data is loaded into memory and references between
            related objects set at initialisation. However overall memory usage will be higher
            than the stream based implementation on lightly loaded environments.
            </para>
            <remarks>
            Initialisation may take several seconds depending on system performance. Initialisation
            calculates all the references between entities. If initialisation is not performed
            then references will be calculated when needed. As such avoiding initialisation
            improves the time taken to create the data set, at the expense of performance for
            the initial detections. The default setting is to initialise the data set.
